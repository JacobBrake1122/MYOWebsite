            <p class="my-font">Shrine is a cursed technique which is used by Ryomen Sukuna, and later on Yuji Itadori. The whole technique is based around kitchens, with the main attacks being dismantle and cleave. He also has a few other things in his arsenal such as divine flame. The domain expansion Sukuna has, <strong>Malevolent Shrine</strong>, has a shrine at the center and sends out slashes until the domain collapses or is closed.</p>

            <p class="my-font">Copy is a technique which is used by Yuta Okkotsu. This technique allows him copy another sorceres technique if Rika (Shikigami bound to him by his ring) absorbs a part of their body. It allows him to use techniques like Jacob's Ladder or Dismantle (After absorbing one of Sukuna's fingers). The domain expansion that Yuta has, <strong>Authentic Mutual Love</strong>, allows him to access all his swords with his copied techniques at the same time. </p>

            <p class="my-font">Ten Shadows is a cursed technique inherited from the Zenin clan. The technique allows the user to summon Shikigami, but only control them if they subjugate the Shikigami first. It is also amplified by the users idea & cursed energy, which is shown clearly when Sukuna creates a much larger version of Nue (A bird Shikigami) than Megumi was able to. The domain expansion Megumi uses, <strong>Chimera Shadow Garden</strong>, incases the area surrounding with his shadows and lets him bring out his Shikigami from anywhere in the domain.</p>

            <p class="my-font">Six Eyes & Limitless are cursed techniques that creates infinite space between the user and allow them to sense everything. This technique inherited from the Gojo clan by Saturo Gojo allows for him to not be hit or touched, but would have to disable it to him someone else. It also comes with things like his negative and positive cursed energy moves such as <strong>blue</strong> and <strong>red</strong>. The domain expansion Gojo has, <strong>Unlimited Void</strong>, forces anyone hit by the sure hit effect to have infinite information with no answers making them not able to do anything.</p>
