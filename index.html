            <p class="my-font"><strong>Shrine</strong> is a cursed technique which is used by <strong>Ryomen Sukuna</strong>, and later on <strong>Yuji Itadori</strong>. <br>The whole technique is based around kitchens, with the main attacks being dismantle and cleave. <br>He also has a few other things in his arsenal such as divine flame. <br>The domain expansion Sukuna has, <strong>Malevolent Shrine</strong>, has a shrine at the center and sends out slashes until the domain collapses or is closed.</p>
        <center><img src="img/jujutsu-kaisen-9.webp" length="250" width="250">
            <p class="my-font"><strong>Copy</strong> is a technique which is used by <strong>Yuta Okkostu</strong>. <br>This technique allows him copy another sorceres technique if Rika (Shikigami bound to him by his ring) absorbs a part of their body. <br>It allows him to use techniques like Jacob's Ladder or Dismantle (After absorbing one of Sukuna's fingers). <br>The domain expansion that Yuta has, <strong>Authentic Mutual Love</strong>, allows him to access all his swords with his copied techniques at the same time. </p>
        <center><img src="img/10sgonna.webp" length="250" width="250">
            <p class="my-font"><strong>Ten Shadows</strong> is a cursed technique inherited from the Zenin clan. <br>The technique allows the user to summon Shikigami, but only control them if they subjugate the Shikigami first. <br>It is also amplified by the users idea & cursed energy, which is shown clearly when <strong>Sukuna</strong> creates a much larger version of Nue (A bird Shikigami) than <strong>Megumi</strong> was able to. <br>The domain expansion Megumi uses, <strong>Chimera Shadow Garden</strong>, incases the area surrounding with his shadows and lets him bring out his Shikigami from anywhere in the domain.</p>
        <center><img src="img/gojo6eyes.webp" length="250" width="250">
            <p class="my-font"><strong>Six Eyes & Limitless</strong> are cursed techniques that creates infinite space between the user and allow them to sense everything. <br>This technique inherited from the Gojo clan by <strong>Saturo Gojo</strong> allows for him to not be hit or touched, but would have to disable it to him someone else. <br>It also comes with things like his negative and positive cursed energy moves such as <strong>blue</strong> and <strong>red</strong>. <br>The domain expansion Gojo has, <strong>Unlimited Void</strong>, forces anyone hit by the sure hit effect to have infinite information with no answers making them not able to do anything.</p>
        <center><img src="img/selfembodimentofperferction.png" length="250" width="250">
            <p class="my-font"><strong>Idle Transfiguration</strong> is a technique posessed by the special grade disaster curse, Mahito. This technique allows him to alter the shape of his own and other people's souls. The body is built around the shape of the soul, so having the ability to change it allows Mahito to affect a person's physical look. When <strong>Mahito</strong> touches a person, he is able to use the technique on them, but in his domain it changes. The domain expansion, <strong>Self Embodiment of Perfection<strong>, causes anyone trapped inside the domain to be hit by the sure hit effect of Idle Transfiguration.</strong></p>
        <center><img src="img/timecellmoonpalace.png" length="250" width="250">
            <p class="my-font"><strong>Projection</strong> is another technique passed down through the zenin clan. The technique allows the user to see their movements as well as others in <strong>24 set frames</strong>. Anyone fighting against this technique can be forced to follow these exact movements, otherwise they'll freeze. The main user of the technique, <strong>Naoya</strong>, has a domain expansion called <strong>Time Cell Moon Palace</strong>. The domain causes anyone trapped inside to be forced to follow the rule of doing what the next 24 frames show, otherwise they could freeze.</p>
